# .net-core-EF-Redis-Cache

This Project in asp.net core show how to use Redis Cache.

Instead of call everytime the database you can use cache to optimizate your search.


To use the project and see how works you have to install redis and execute the service, or just put a container with redis and will work.

I use Entity Framework to get the data of the base more easily


Just do git clone https://github.com/Rodsafreitas/net-core-EF-Redis-Cache.git to get the project
